        <h1>IoT Based Water Level Sensor</h1>
        <hr color="black" width="90%">
        <p>The water level sensing system for monitoring and control presents a comprehensive solution for monitoring and managing water level in various applications. The project aims to address critical need for efficient water resource management and conservation. This system is used to detect and notify the user about the level of water in a container/tank. It is also used to detect leakage in pipes and automatically handle the problem by turning off the water pump. In addition to monitoring purposes, the collected water level data can be utilized for various control strategies. For instance, the system can trigger automated actions such as activating pumps to maintain optimal water levels, sending alerts when levels exceed predefined thresholds, or even providing data inputs for predictive analytics.
