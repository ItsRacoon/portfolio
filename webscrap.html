        <p>This project is a web scraping tool developed using Python for monitoring and analyzing a specific website. The tool collects data from the target website at regular intervals, extracting relevant information such as prices, product details, or any other specified metrics. It employs libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape web pages efficiently. The extracted data is then stored in a structured format, allowing for easy analysis and visualization. Additionally, the tool can be configured to send notifications or alerts based on predefined conditions, enabling proactive monitoring of changes or trends on the website. This project showcases proficiency in web scraping techniques, data processing, and automation using Python, as well as the ability to develop a practical tool for real-world applications in website monitoring and analysis.
